Creating a comprehensive machine learning pipeline with a random forest classifier to assess if fraudulent activity has occurred for a transaction

We were given a dataset with around 6 million rows, with a goal to build a machine learning pipeline to classify fraudulent transactions. I chose to utilize a random forest classifier for this task. The project presents an interesting problem because there is a strong class imbalance as most transaction are not fraudulent. The columns included transaction type, original and updated balance in the account that initiated the transaction, originial and updated balance in the account that received the transaction and a labal, isFraud in which 0 represents a genuine transaction and 1 a fradulent transaction. I followed the process of first conduction Exploratory Data Analaysis inlucding univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Next, I cleaned and wrangled the dataset to check for missing values and one hot encoded the type column. Finally, I created a random forest model which achieved an accuracy score of 99.97%, and then I conducted a random search to find the best hyperparameters.
