1. The Exploratory data analysis helped me to understand the size of the datast and the columns within it. I realized that 6 million rows would be too much for my computer to handle, so I had to load in 1 million rows. I also learned that most of the transactions within the dataset were not fraudulent, which could lead to a strong class imbalance in the model. By plotting some of the features, I was able to observe the distribution. The column amount displayed a right skewed distribution. The column type, which represented the transaction type, showed a slight right skew, as most transaction types were payments, cash in or cash out.

2. Within examining the dataset, I realized that the columns nameOrig and nameDest were not useful. They were objects that represented the name on the account that initiated the transaction and the name on the account that recieved the amount. For the purposes of our fraud detection pipeline, these 2 columns could not provide any useful information. I also decided to drop the isFlaggedFraud column. Upon looking at the description of the column, I realized that it flags all transactions above a certain amount as fradulent which is incorrect. This would negatively impact my model so I decided to drop this columns as well.

3. I first attempted to use grid search for hyperparameter tuning but my computer could not handle running it and after an hour it still had not completed. I then decided to switch to randomsearch but after 30 min even that was not working. I decided to take a sample of 10,000 rows for the randomsearch in order to let it work more efficiently. This proved successful and it allowed my computer to complete the search.

4. I assumed that after discovering the optimal hyperparameters, the model performance would either stay the same since it was already 99.97 % accurate or slightly improve. The accuracy actaully dropped a little bit. I believe this is because I also used the top 5 features and due to the nature of this dataset, each feature may be neccesary for the performance of the model

5. For transactions that are not fraudulent, the f1 score stayed at 1 while for the transactions that are actually fraudulent, the f1 score went from 0.73 to NaN. I was not able to figure out why that occurred. I beleive that the original model was the best since it had the best accuracy, precision, recall and f1score for both cases.
